## 🎨 My Pookalam

### Description
This Pookalam design mixes traditional symmetry with bright festive colors. The central floral pattern stands for unity and prosperity. It is surrounded by layers of geometric shapes that represent balance and harmony. The green, orange, pink, and yellow colors reflect the joyful spirit of Onam and the beauty of Kerala’s cultural heritage. The goal was to create a simple but elegant design that spreads positivity and celebration.

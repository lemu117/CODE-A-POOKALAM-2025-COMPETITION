### Description
🌸 This Pookalam design blends traditional symmetry with vibrant festive colors. The central floral pattern symbolizes unity and prosperity, surrounded by layers of geometric motifs that represent balance and harmony. The use of green, orange, pink, and yellow reflects the joyful spirit of Onam and the beauty of Kerala’s cultural heritage.

### Features
  ✨ The colorful geometric pattern stands out through its vivid colors such as green, yellow, pink, orange, and white that bring vibrancy and celebration. Its symmetry and balance, achieved through repeated geometric shapes arranged in circular layers, add harmony to the design. A mix of diamonds, circles, and triangles enhances structure and rhythm, while the central floral motif symbolizes prosperity and cultural roots. The layered, concentric arrangement creates a sense of depth and completeness, and together the colors and shapes reflect festive symbolism, conveying joy, unity, and tradition.

🎨 Beyond its aesthetic beauty, the design offers interactive elements that engage viewers. Color transitions and alternating hues add visual movement, while symmetry invites exploration of repeating shapes and hidden details. The pattern naturally draws the eye inward, creating a journey from the outer layers to the core. It also allows for personalization, as viewers may imagine adding their own colors or motifs. Most importantly, the Pookalam serves as a cultural connection, becoming an interactive tradition where people gather, contribute petals, and co-create the design, reinforcing togetherness and celebration.

### Features
The colorful geometric pattern stands out with its vivid colors like green, yellow, pink, orange, and white that bring vibrancy and celebration. Its symmetry and balance come from repeated geometric shapes arranged in circular layers, adding harmony to the design. A mix of diamonds, circles, and triangles gives it structure and rhythm, while the central floral motif symbolizes prosperity and cultural roots. The layered, concentric arrangement creates a sense of depth and completeness. Together, the colors and shapes reflect festive symbolism, conveying joy, unity, and tradition.

Beyond its visual appeal, the design includes interactive elements that engage viewers. Color transitions and changing hues create visual movement, while symmetry encourages exploration of repeating shapes and hidden details. The pattern naturally draws the eye inward, leading from the outer layers to the core. It also invites personalization, as viewers may imagine adding their own colors or motifs. Most importantly, the Pookalam serves as a cultural connection. It becomes a tradition where people gather, contribute petals, and co-create the design, reinforcing togetherness and celebration.
